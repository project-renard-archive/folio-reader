refactoring.

Requires from CPAN:

* Moo (libmoo-perl)
* File::Slurp (libfile-slurp-perl)
* Imager libimager-perl
* PDL (pdl)
* Tkx

Binary packages:

* Tk (tk) (8.5 or greater)
* Tk-img (libtk-img)

And the packages from:

* <https://github.com/zmughal/fetch-paper>
* <https://github.com/zmughal/mupdf-perl>
